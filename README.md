# Maven Challenge - coffee Excel-Dashboard
Here is Maven Challenge - coffee project. 

The project concerns comprehensively handled sales data of the cafes in 3 different locations over a 6-month period. Access to the distribution network, 
customer data and transaction information extracted from the network, such as identification of behavioral patterns, peak sales times, popular products 
and periodic products. Using the Excel tool, I thoroughly processed and visualized the data.
The file contains 4 sheets (raw data, cleaned data, illustrations and dashboard).
I started analyzing the results by cleaning the data, correcting the column format, filtering and sorting.
This focused on key aspects such as data generation and ancillary transactions. 
Revenues range from PLN 82,000. addition in deletion up to 166 thousand which means more than doubling in the given period, 
providing a 103.82% increase. Note the constant upward trend from month to month, which means a negative sales result.
The analysis also presents the peak of transactional analysis, which falls at 7.00-10.00, which can be applied based on the number of user visits, 
causing breakfast hours or commuters to appear.
It is worth including that products from the coffee category are leading in sales, which indicates that they are one of the generators leading to the company. 
Bakery products that perform poorly in terms of transactions, slowing down to general sales.
Key indicators:
- There is a consistent significant growth rate of 103.82% in income from month to month (January - June).

  This may be the reason for changes in the weather, seasonal preferences or local events.
- There is a significant increase in transactions in the hours 7.00-10.00, and a significant decrease in activity after 8 p.m.
  this knowledge can contribute to optimizing the caf√©'s operating hours.
